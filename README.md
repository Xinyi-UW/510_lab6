# 510_lab6

## Overview

This lab is about learning frontend development. The project achieves a chatbox that allows architects to get inspiration during their ideation design stage. To further improve, you need to learn more about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and knowledge graphs to build a better visualized interface for architects.

## Getting Started

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Debugging Experiences

### 1. Git Clone Process

Connecting a local git repository to a remote GitHub repository often encounters similar problems. Hereâ€™s an improved process:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub with a `README.md`.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
3. Create `app.py` and new files in VS Code, then push them to the repository to check how it works:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```
